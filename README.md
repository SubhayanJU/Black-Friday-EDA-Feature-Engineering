# Black-Friday-EDA-Feature-Engineering

## Project Overview

This project delves into the analysis and prediction of sales patterns using the Black Friday dataset. It encompasses detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), insightful visualizations, and robust feature engineering techniques. The ultimate goal is to build a predictive model to understand customer behavior and forecast sales.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of transactional records from a retail store during Black Friday. It includes various features such as:
- User ID
- Product ID
- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- City Category
- Stay in Current City Years
- Marital Status
- Product Category
- Purchase Amount

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to uncover initial patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using statistical graphics. The following libraries are utilized for visualization:
- **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **seaborn**: For making attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Key Insights from EDA
- Distribution of purchase amounts.
- Spending patterns based on gender, age, and occupation.
- Purchase trends across different product categories and city tiers.
- Seasonal and temporal analysis of purchase behavior.

## Feature Engineering

To enhance the predictive power of the dataset, several feature engineering steps are undertaken:
1. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.
2. **Standardization**: Standardizing numerical features to bring all features to a similar scale, which helps in improving the convergence of the machine learning algorithms.

## Conclusion

The project provides a detailed understanding of customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday sales. It highlights the power of EDA and feature engineering in preparing the data for effective predictive modeling.
